# Code Test Generator

The `main.py` program in the `code-test-generator` module is a script that generates code snippets and corresponding tests based on user-provided tasks and programming languages.

## Description

The script uses the OpenAI language model to generate code snippets and tests. The user can specify the task and the programming language as command-line arguments. If no arguments are provided, the script defaults to generating a Python function that returns a list of numbers.

The script uses two prompt templates: one for generating the code snippet and one for generating the test. The code snippet prompt asks the language model to "Write a very short {language} function that will {task}." The test prompt asks the language model to "Write a {language} test for the following code:\n{code}".

The script uses the `LLMChain` class from the `langchain` library to chain these prompts together. The result is a code snippet and a corresponding test, both generated by the language model.

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --task "your task here" --language "your language here"
